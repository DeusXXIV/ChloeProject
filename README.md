ONGOING PROJECT

Chloe is a website for tracking all sorts of media for your personal lists. Instead of the usual "community rating" websites, the main purpose of Chloe is to track which episode you are at, 
make notes about important scenes or scenes you want to bookmark in an episode of a series. The user can both rely on the database of media or create their own posting for media that is not in the database.
